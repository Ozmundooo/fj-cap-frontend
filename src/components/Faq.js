          The first session is usually focused on completing a comprehensive
          clinical assessment to determine your primary concerns, and needs, and
          discussing your treatment goals. Upon completing your assessment, I
          will propose a treatment plan tailored to your specific unique needs.

          Psychotherapy is not covered by OHIP. Many extended health insurance
          or employee benefit plans, partially or fully, cover psychotherapy
          services. Freshta Jamasi Counselling & Psychotherapy does not bill
          directly to insurance. You will be provided with a receipt for the
          service.
          <br></br>
          You may find it helpful to ask your insurance provider the following
          questions:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            Does my health insurance plan include psychotherapy or services
            offered by a registered psychotherapist?
          </li>
          <li>Do I have a deductible? What is it and have I met it?</li>
          <li>
            Does my plan limit the number of sessions per calendar year? What is
            the limit?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do I need a referral from my primary care physician to cover my
            services?
          </li>
        </ul>

          Many healthcare insurance providers will cover the services we
          provide. I am a licensed practitioner by the CRPO as a Registered
          Psychotherapist (Qualifying). If your benefits cover Registered
          Psychotherapy, you may be eligible for full reimbursement. We always
          suggest you inquire with your provider to see what your unique plan
          entails before booking with one of our therapists.
